Privacy Policy for Anubis Chrome Extension
Effective Date: 04/04/2025

Thank you for using the Anubis Chrome extension ("Extension"), a tool that helps you find the best deals on AliExpress. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Extension. By using the Extension, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Data We Collect
Anubis does not collect any personal information. The Extension only collects the data necessary for it to function as described:

Active Tab Data: The activeTab permission allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab. This enables the extension to gather product details (such as product name, price, and seller information) from AliExpress pages that you are actively viewing.

Storage: The storage permission allows us to store user preferences and settings locally on your device, such as saved deal alerts and preferred filters. This data is only stored on your device and is not shared with any third parties.

2. How We Use Your Data
Product Information: We gather product information only for the purpose of displaying relevant deals, price history, and discounts for products you view on AliExpress.

User Preferences: We use the data stored in the local storage to enhance your experience with the Extension, remembering your preferences and settings across sessions (such as custom filters or alert preferences).

No Personal Identifiable Information: We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email, or payment details.

3. Third-Party Services
The Extension does not share, sell, or transfer any personal information to third parties. However, we may display links to AliExpress and other external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites they visit.

4. Permissions
The Anubis Extension requests the following permissions:

activeTab: This allows the Extension to access the content of the active tab (AliExpress product pages) to extract relevant data.

storage: This allows the Extension to save your preferences and settings locally on your device.

host permissions (for AliExpress): This permission enables the Extension to interact with AliExpress product pages to display deals and discounts.

5. Security
We take the security of your data seriously. The data stored locally on your device (such as preferences and settings) is kept private and is not shared with any third parties. We do not have access to any personal data or browsing activity that is not part of the functionality of the Extension.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes to how we handle your data, we will notify you through the Extension or by other means. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
